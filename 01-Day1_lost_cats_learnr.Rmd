#### Let's start!


## Read data


The first step of an analysis is finding the data you need. Here's an example data table that shows my favorite cats.

```{r ex-data1, echo=F, message=F, warning=F}
library("readr")
library("tibble")
library("knitr")

my_cats <- "Name,Age,Color              
            Mr. Sauce,3,Salt-n-pepper        
            Sad Face,2,Tabby
            Noodles,6,Calico"

new_tbl <- read_csv(my_cats)

kable(new_tbl)
```

<br>

> How do we get this data into R?

<br>

### CSV to the rescue

The main data format in R is the __CSV__ _(comma-separated values)_. A __CSV__ is a simple text file that can be opened in R and most other stats software (including Excel).  

Here's what the example cat table looks like when it is saved as a __CSV__ file. 

__my_cats.csv__  

```
Name,Age,Color  
Mr. Sauce,3,Salt-n-pepper  
Two Face,2,Tabby  
Noodles,6,Calico  
```

It looks squished together right now, but that's okay. When it's opened in R the text will become a familiar looking table with columns and rows. __CSVs__ are like those amazing dinosaur sponges that grow in water over night.  
  
<br>  

Click the green _Run Code_ button below to produce a nice cat table called `my_cats`.

```{r create-cats}
library(readr)
library(tibble)

my_cats <- "Name,Age,Color              
            Mr. Sauce,3,Salt-n-pepper        
            Sad Face,2,Tabby
            Noodles,6,Calico"
 
new_tbl <- read_csv(my_cats)
```


```{r cat_csv, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "create-cats"}
library(readr)

read_csv(my_cats)

```

<br>

### <i class="fa fa-user-secret" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#040707;"></i> Pro-tip!

You may have noticed the row of three letter abbreviations under the column names. These describe the data type of each column.

> `chr` stands for __character__ vector, or a string of characters. Ex: _"apple"_, _"apple5"_, _"5 red apples"_  
> `int` stands for __integer__. Ex: _5_, _34_, _1071_

We'll see more data types -such as `dates`- in later lessons.

<br>

### Pop Quiz, hotshot!  

```{r q-dtype, echo=FALSE}

quiz(
question("What data type is the `Color` column?",
  answer("_letters_"),
  answer("_character_", correct = TRUE, message = encourage()),
  answer("_words_"),
  answer("_numbers_"),
  answer("_integer_"),
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  incorrect   = "Almost!"),
caption = " "
)

```

### Nice work! 

Let's look a bit closer at the R code.

```{r, eval = F}
library(readr)

read_csv(my_cats)
```

1. The 1st line uses the `library()` function to load the _readr_ package.  
2. The 2nd line uses the `read_csv()` function to import the table _my_cats_.  

<br>

> What is a package?

<br>

### _readr_

![](https://d21ii91i3y6o6h.cloudfront.net/gallery_images/from_proof/9289/medium/1447092171/readr-hexbin-sticker-from-rstudio.png){align="left" width="145" style="margin-right:18px;"}

<br>

A _package_ is a small add-on for R. They make things easier and add capabilities like statistical functions, mapping powers, and special charts.  

The _readr_ package helps import data into R. It does extra work for you like cleaning the data of extra white space and formatting dates. Packages are like phone apps for R. Your packages are stored in your _library_. 

<br>

__Key terms__  

`Package` An add-on for R that someone created to help you. It's like an App for R.  
`library` The name of the folder that stores your packages.  
`function` An R command that takes input and gives you something back. Ex: `read_csv()`  

<br>


### Name your table

You can give your table a name by using a `<-` _(left-arrow)_ that points to the name. 

Try it below. _Hint: You'll need to enter something to make the table appear._
```{r cat_csv_name, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "create-cats"}

new_tbl <- read_csv(my_cats)

# To view the table, type its name below 


#
```

<br>

### Pop Quiz, hotshot!  

```{r q-pkg, echo=FALSE}

quiz(
question("What package does `read_csv()` come from?",
  answer("_dionsaur_"),
  answer("_get_data_"),
  answer("_readr_", correct = TRUE, message = encourage()),
  answer("_dplyr_"),
  answer("_tidyr_"),
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  incorrect   = "Almost!"),

question("How would you load the package `catfinder`?",
  answer("_library()_"),
  answer("_library(catfinder)_", correct = TRUE, message = encourage()),
  answer("_load(catfinder)_"),
  answer("_package(catfinder)_"),
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  incorrect   = "Almost!"),
caption = "Double Quiz"
)

```


<br>

## Pet detective

### _The case of the mopey cat_

<img src="http://pre15.deviantart.net/653f/th/pre/i/2016/006/5/9/cat_in_the_rain_by_northumbrianartist-d9mzdda.jpg", align="right" width="250" style="margin-left:15px;">

Oh no! On your way home you find a _wet_ and _mopey_ cat sitting on your front stoop. It looks so sad, maybe you can bring it inside and give it some milk.   

When you pick up the cat you notice a collar with a __number__ on it. 

> _HINT: Check under your keyboard for your cat's tag number._ 

This gives you an idea! Your friend recently mentioned a list that has all the missing cats people have reported. Maybe you can use the tag number to help find your lost kitty's home.


<br>

## It's inspector time!

![](http://orig00.deviantart.net/cf6c/f/2017/054/b/6/inspector_gadget_by_domejohnny-db04gni.png){align="right" width=250 style="-webkit-transform: scaleX(-1); transform: scaleX(-1); margin-right: 80px; margin-top: -10px"}


__Start a new project__

Let's open a new dossier on this mystery cat. 

- In _Rstudio_ select _File_ from the top menu bar
- Choose _New Project..._
- Choose _New Directory_
- Choose _New Project_
- Enter a project names such as `"mystery_cat"`
- Select _Browse..._ and choose a folder where you normally perform your work. 
- Click _Create Project_

<br>

__Open a new script__

- In the upper left, click on the white file icon with the green (+) sign. 
- Select _R Script_.

![](http://docplayer.net/docs-images/25/5462802/images/10-0.png){width=450}

<br>


__Heading__

Add a brief description of your new case to the script using the comment symbol `#`.

```{r comments, exercise = TRUE}
# This file documents my search for the home of a lost cat I found this evening.

# What I know so far
animal  <- "cat"

tag_num <- 444

pet_dective <- "Agent Cooper"

# Next steps
# 1. Find the missing cat database.
#
```

<br>

__Save script__

- Click on the floppy disk icon
- Enter a file name such as `find_cat.R`

<br>

Now let's find ourselves some clues.


## All the cats!

Thanks to your friend you downloaded a list of all the missing cats from [missing-cats.com]().  

<br>

__Find the file__

Open this folder in a new window `X:\Agency_Files\Outcomes\Risk_Eval_Air_Mod\_Air_Risk_Evaluation\R\R_Camp\Student Folder`

Find the file _missing_cat_list.csv_. There are 2 great tricks to copy the file's location.

1. Hold Shift + Right click on the file name. Select "Copy as path" from the menu.
1. Copy the folder location from the path at the top of the explorer window. 

<br>

__Add the file location to your script__

Now you can paste the file's location into the `read_csv()` function. 


Here's a code snippet to get you started.
```{r snip1, exercise = TRUE}
library(readr)

missing <- read_csv("X:/...")

```

<div class="toggle"><button class = "btn_code">_Show solution_</button>
<br>
```
missing  <- read_csv("X:/Agency_Files/Outcomes/Risk_Eval_Air_Mod/_Air_Risk_Evaluation/R/R_Camp/Student Folder/missing_cat_list.csv")
```
</div>
<br>

#### <i class="fa fa-user-secret" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#040707;"></i> Pro-tip!

> File paths in R use forward slashes (`/`). In Windows you'll need to switch backslashes (`\`) to forward slashes (`/`). 
>
> A file on your desktop located at `C:\Desktop\file.csv` would be read into R as `C:/Desktop/file.csv`
  
<br>

__Load the data__

1. Move the blinking cursor in the script window to the `missing <- read...` line. 
1. Press _CTRL + ENTER_ to run the command.

<br>


__View all the missing cats__

Look in the upper right hand window of RStudio. This is the _Environment_ window that shows all of the data frames you have created this session. You can see the names of the data frames, the number of observations (rows), and the number of variables (columns). This is helpful if you ever need to count your data (_Hint_ _Hint_).  

To see __all__ the cat data click on the table called `missing` in the _Environment_ window. 

> "Wow! There's over 2,000 missing cats."

That's a lot of cats. And more bad news. There's no column for tag numbers. So which cat is yours? Let's see... Does your cat look more like a _Mr. Buttons_ or a _Furry Potter_? That's a tough call. We need more information!  

Let's explore the missing cat data a bit more. Hopefully we can find some way to pick out your cat.

<br>

### Pop Quiz, hotshot!

```{r column-q, echo=FALSE}
quiz(
question("What is the second column in the _missing_ cat data frame?",
  answer("_age_"),
  answer("_gender_"),
  answer("_Doorknob_"),
  answer("_color_", correct = TRUE, message = encourage()),
  answer("_column_2_"),
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  incorrect   = "Almost!"),
caption = " "
)
```


## __dplyr__


![](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/071952491ec4a6a532a3f70ecfa2507af4d341f9/c167c/images/hex-dplyr.png){width="120" align="left" style="margin-right: 20px; margin-top: 8px"}

<br>

_You've unlocked a new package!_  

The _dplyr_ package is the go-to tool for exploring, re-arranging, and summarizing data.  

<br><br>

Use `install.packages("dplyr")` to add _dplyr_ to your detective library.  

<br>

__Your analysis toolbox:__ The key _dplyr_ functions

| Function      | Returns                                           |  
|:--------------|:--------------------------------------------------|  
| `arrange()`   | reorder or sort rows by value of a column         |  
| `filter()`    | pick a subset of rows by the value of a column    |  
| `mutate()`    | create a new columns                              | 
| `group_by()`  | split data into groups by values in a column      |  
| `summarize()` | create a single summary value for the entire table or each group |   

<br>

## `arrange()`

<br>

Use the `arrange()` function to sort data based on one or more of the columns in the table. Let's use `arrange()` to answer some questions about the missing cats. 

- Which cats are the most grumpy?
- Which cats are the oldest?
- Are there cats from Australia?
   - What are the oldest cats from Australia?

```{r arrange, exercise = TRUE}
library(dplyr)

# Sort by the grumpy column
missing <- arrange(missing, grumpy)

# Enter the table name to view the ordered data
missing

# To sort in descending order (highest to lowest) 
# Add desc() around the column name
missing <- arrange(missing, desc(grumpy))


# View the top 5 rows using head()
head(missing)

# Aussie cats


# Ancient Aussie cats


```
<br>


### <i class="fa fa-user-secret" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#040707;"></i> Pro-tip!

> When you save an arranged data table it maintains its order. This is perfect for sending people a quick __Top 10__ list of pollutants or sites.


## `filter()`

<br>

The `filter()` function creates a subset of the data based on the value of one or more columns. Use `filter()` to answer the questions below.

<br>

_What are the cat names that are only 1 year old?_

```{r filter12, exercise = TRUE}

filter(missing, age == 1)

```


### <i class="fa fa-user-secret" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#040707;"></i> Pro-tip!
> We use a `==` (double equals sign) for comparing values. A `==` makes the comparison "is it equal to?" and returns a True or False answer. So the code above returns all the rows where the condition `age == 1` is TRUE.  
>
> A single equals sign (`=`) is used within functions to set options, for example `read_csv(data = "mydata.csc")`. Don't worry too much. If you use the wrong symbol R is often helpful and will let you know which one is needed.


### Comparisons

To use filtering effectively you’ll want to know how to select observations using various comparison operators.

_Key comparison operators_

| Symbol| Comparison               |  
|:----|:------------------------|  
| `>`   | greater than             |  
| `>=`  | greater than or equal to |  
| `<`   | less than                |  
| `<=`  | less than or equal to    |  
| `==`  | equal to                 | 
| `!=`  | not equal to             | 
| `%in%`| value is in a list       | 
  

<br> 


_What are the cat names that have a grumpy score greater than 6?_
```{r filter2, eval = F}

filter(missing, grumpy ...)

```

<br>

_What are the cat names that are either striped or orange in color?_

```{r, eval =F}

filter(missing, color %in% c("orange", "striped"))

```

<br>

> _What is the `c()` thing?_  

You can put multiple values inside _c()_ to make a list of items. Each item in the list is separated by a comma. The `c` stands for to _conCATenate_ or to _combine_ values.
  
You can give your lists names in the same way as data frames. Let's create a short list of your favorite colors.

```{r colors22, exercise = TRUE}
# This is an example vector
my_fave_colors <- c("green", "orange", "cornflower")

my_fave_colors
```

<br>

__Create a small table called `uk_oldies` that only has cats from the UK and are older than 20.__    

_Work with your neighbor to create the table._

<br>


### Cat challenge 

> Ask your neighbor a question about the cat data that requires the __%in%__ operator. 
>
> Try to answer your neighbor's question.

<br>


### Pop Quiz, hotshot!

```{r count-color, echo=FALSE}

quiz(
question("Are there more striped colored cats or butterscotch cats?",
  answer("_more butterscotch_"),
  answer("_more striped_",  correct = TRUE, message = encourage()),
  answer("_same amount in both groups_"),
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  incorrect   = "Almost!"),
caption = " "
)

```

_Hint: Start by creating a new table called `striped` using the code `filter(missing, color == ...)`_

## Cat challenge #2

Team up with your neighbor to think of a summary question to ask about the missing cat data. Ask the question to the pair of students sitting across the center row from you. They'll ask you a question about the cats in return. 

_Work with your neighbor to find the answer._

<br>

__Quick stretch break  <i class="fa fa-hourglass-half" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#040707;"></i>__ 

Stand up. Move around.

<br>


## Play time

Now that you are more familiar with the data, maybe you can use the personality traits of the missing cats to find which one is yours.

> If only you knew the personality of your cat!

Well that can't be too hard. Spend some time getting to know your cat. Is it already hiding from you under the couch? Does it seem Australian? Is it really young? Once you've gotten to know your cat, move on to the next section.

<br>

## Cat traits

_Congratulations! You've unlocked your cat's personality._

Thanks to all the quality time you spent with your cat, you can now read in a table describing your cat's personality. Use the cat's tag number to read the correct file from this folder `X:\Agency_Files\Outcomes\Risk_Eval_Air_Mod\_Air_Risk_Evaluation\R\R_Camp\Student Folder\Found cats`

<br>

Here's a snippet to get you started.
```{r, eval=F}
library(readr)

mycat <- read_csv("X:/.../foundcat_tag##.csv")

```

<br>

Take a minute to explore your cat's traits.

<br>

## Find your cat

Almost there! Now you can use `filter` to check if the _missing_ table has a cat with a similar personality as yours.  

_Fingers crossed!_

```{r, eval=F}

the_one <- filter(missing, 
                  greedy  == ?, 
                  playful == ?, 
                  age    ...)

```


_Hint: You can also use the cat's `age` to help narrow down the number of potential cats._

<br>

## Success!

<br>

You found your cat! I'd say you've earned yourself a detective badge for the day. Hey, maybe you could even make a business out of this.

Let's celebrate and meet everyone's cat.

<br>

__Meet the R cats! <i class="fa fa-group" aria-hidden="true" style="color:black;"></i>__


Introduce your _found cat_.

> - Found cat's name and best personality trait.  
> - Your name or detective name.  
> - Common data you look at?      
> - Types of charts or maps you want to make?  
> - Dog or Cat? No pressure.

<br>

__Break time <i class="fa fa-hourglass-half" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#040707;"></i>__ 

Take 10 minutes to relax. See you back here for more cat mysteries.

## You have voicemail (1)

Your neighbor just called. He has bad news. His cat has gone missing. He was so worked-up the only thing you could make out in the message was a description of how great his cat's personality was. Here are the few details you jotted down.

_My neighbor's great cat_

> The cat's clumsiness and its greediness scores combined are more than 12.
> You could barely make this out, but you think the cat's grumpiness and playfulness only sum to 6. 
> And it's a female cat.
> Oh and his cat is the same age as him _(in human years)_, which is probably around 85.

It sounds like we're going to need some math for this puzzle. Let's calculate some new columns with `mutate()` to help find our neighbor's cat.

To prepare, make sure you have the `missing` data table loaded into R, and the `mycat` table with the personality traits for your lost cat.


## `mutate()`

It's often useful to add new columns that are functions of existing columns. That’s the job of `mutate() `.

### Human years

In our work we use `mutate` to calculate new units for measurments. In this case, let's estimate the cat ages in human years. We'll use the equation below to convert cat years to human years.

> __Human years__ = Cat years * 4 + 20

### Add human years

Use `mutate()` to add a column called `human_age` to the table _mycat_.

```{r, eval=F}

mycat <- mutate(mycat, 
                human_age = age * ....)

```

<br>

You can also add a `found_by` column. That way people will know where to send the reward money\$\$.
```{r, eval=F}

mycat <- mutate(mycat, 
                found_by = "Agent Cooper")

```

<br>

### Find your neighbor's cat

Now let's see if you can use `mutate()` to help match the description of the cat's personality.

Use `mutate()` to add columns to the missing cat list, and then `filter()` the new columns to narrow the list down to your neighbor's cat.

Here's a reminder of how your neighbor described his cat.

> The cat's clumsiness and its greediness scores combined are more than 12.
> You could barely make this out, but you think the cat's grumpiness and playfulness only sum to 6. 
> And it's a female cat.


Here's a snippet to get you started.
```{r neighbor1, eval=F}
library(dplyr)

nei_cat <- mutate(missing, 
                  clumsy_and_greedy  = clumsy + greedy,
                  grumpy_and_playful = grumpy + ...,
                  human_age = age * 4 + 20
                  ) 

nei_cat <- filter(nei_cat,
                  clumsy_and_greedy  > ...,
                  grumpy_and_playful == ...,
                  human_age > ...
                  )

```


<br>

You can chain these two functions together and do everything in one go. For that you can use the `%>%` (pipe).


![](https://d21ii91i3y6o6h.cloudfront.net/gallery_images/from_proof/9302/medium/1447173978/rstudio-hex-pipe-dot-psd.png){width="100" align="left" style="margin-right:20px;"}

<br>

In a script the `%>%` is read as "and then". In the code below we are telling R to `mutate` the data __and then__ to `filter` it.

<br>
<br>

```{r neighbor2, eval=F}

nei_cat <- mutate(missing, 
                  clumsy_and_greedy  = clumsy + greedy,
                  grumpy_and_playful = grumpy + playful,
                  human_age = age * 4 + 20) %>%
          filter(clumsy_and_greedy  > 12,
                 grumpy_and_playful == 6,
                 human_age > 80)

```



<br>

### Pop Quiz, hotshot!

```{r friend-cat, echo=FALSE}
quiz(
question("What is your friend's cat's name?",
  answer("_Damon_"),    
  answer("_Fluffy George_", correct = TRUE, message = encourage()),
  answer("_Stinkerbell_"),
  answer("_Precious Abe_"),
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  incorrect   = "Almost!"),
caption = " "
)
```


## Guess the Cat

![](https://i.upworthy.com/nugget/530baf6f46d669b92a00001f/guess-who-game-9e782ebefa57a5fea47e29386f99b356.jpg){width="250" align="right" style="margin-top: -30px; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 36px;"}

<br>

Are you the best cat detective out there? Let's play a game to find out.

__The rules__  

1. Scroll through the missing cat list and find a cat you like.
1. __Don't let your neighbor see the cat you chose.__
1. Take turns asking each other questions about their cat. 
1. Use the answers you receive to build a big `filter()` function that you can use to narrow down the potential cats. 
1. Elusive answers are encouraged.
    - For example, when someone asks you _How grumpy is your cat?_ 
    - You can respond, _My cat's age is eqaul to two less than its playfulness._ Or if you're feeling generous, you can give a more straightforward answer, such as _My cat's grumpiness is definitely not 2._
1. The winner is the first to guess their neighbor's cat.
    
   
If you have time, play another round. Best of 3? 

We'll play for 7 minutes.

## The case of the paper tiger

Just when you thought you'd take the day off. Ha! As soon as you sit down to drink your morning coffee the front page of the paper jumps out at you. According to the article there's been a whole string of striped kittens reported missing. _Is there foul play afoot or is this mere coincidence?_ Sounds like a case for a pet detective.

The paper is pointing its finger at a circus that came to town and is drawing big crowds with their adorable "tiger babies".

> What evidence can we collecct from the missing cat database to support or refute the claim that the circus is stealing young striped cats?

To do this we're going to learn a new function.

<br>

## `summarize()`

<br>

`summarize` is a powerful function that allows you to do math on a column or multiple columns to provide a summary across the whole data set. It can boil your data down to single summary value. To really dig into `summarize` you'll want to know some common math functions such as `mean()`, `median()`, and `max()`.


### `mean()`
Use `summarize()` and `mean()` to calculate the mean level of grumpiness in all cats.

```{r, eval=F}
missing_summary <- summarize(missing, average_age = mean(age, na.rm = T))

```

> Note the "na.rm" in the `mean()` function. This tells R to ignore empty cells that show up in R as `NA`. All the cats have ages, but if someone forgot to enter an age and the cell included 'NA', then the mean funciton would return an 'NA'.


### `median()`
Use summarize to calculate the _median_ level of grumpiness in all cats.


### `max()`
Use summarize to calculate the _maximum_ playfullness score for all cats.


### `min()`
Use summarize to calculate the _minimum_ of scores for how `fearful_of_people` cats are.


### `sd()`
What is the _standard deviation_ of the grumpiness scores?


### `quantile()`
_Quantiles_ are useful for finding the upper or lower range of a data set. Use the `quantile()` function to find the the 5th and 95th quantile of the cat ages.

```{r quants, eval = FALSE}

missing_quants <- summarize(missing, 
                            age_5th_quant  = quantile(age, 0.05),
                            age_95th_quant = quantile(age, 0.95))

```


<br>

## Striped cats

Let's use `summarize()` to answer some questions about the striped cats.

_Is the age of missing `striped` cats lower than expected?_


What's the median age for the all the missing cats?
```{r all_cats_age, eval = FALSE}

summarize(missing, median_age = median(age))

```


What's the median age for the striped cats?
```{r striped_age, eval = FALSE}

filter(missing, color == "striped") %>% summarize(striped_median_age = median(age))

```


<br>

There must be a better way to compare the ages between groups.

<br>

> Wouldn't it be great if we could easily generate the count or the age of missing cats for every color group?


<br>

## `group_by()`

<br>

Here's where you really can fly with your data. If you thought `summarize` was awesome, wait until you include `group_by` with your `summarize` commands. 

Try using `group_by` with the column _color_, and then use `summarize` to count the number of cats.
```{r count-by-color, eval = FALSE}

missing_by_color <- group_by(missing, color) %>% 
                        summarize(count  =  n())

```

<br>

###<i class="fa fa-user-secret" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#040707;"></i> Pro-tip!
> Use `n()` to count the number of observations for an entire table or group.

<br>

Well that's interesting. I'm not seeing any conclusive evidence here.

<br>

_What about the age of the missing striped cats? Are they younger on average?_

Use `group_by` with the column _color_ amd _age_, and then use `summarize` to find the total count 
```{r age-by-color, eval = FALSE}

ages_by_color <- group_by(missing, color, age) %>% 
                    summarize(cat_count =  n()) %>%
                    arrange(cat_count)

```

<br>


Another way to compare ages is to use `mean(age)`. Use `group_by` with the column _color_, and then use `summarize` to find the _mean_ age for each cat color. Finally, use `arrange()` to sort the table by median age.
```{r mean_age-by-color, eval = FALSE}

ages_by_color <- group_by(missing, color) %>% 
                    summarize(mean_age =  mean(age, na.rm = T)) %>%
                    arrange(mean_age)

```


### Bad news

Uh oh! Why are the _striped_ cats so much younger? Are they being sent to the circus? Let's put this piece of evidence in our back pocket for now. We'll return to it when we're making charts. Maybe we'll be able to put together a convincing argument that we can send to the police chief later. 

<br>

## Save files

Let's save the last summary table we created to a _CSV_. That way we can easily send it to the police later. To save a data frame we use the `write_csv()` function from our favorite _readr_ package. 

It looks like this.
```{r, eval = F}

write_csv(ages_by_color, "mean_cat_ages_by_color.csv")

```

<br>

## `group_by()` practice

<br>

_Let's say you want to know the median grumpiness scores of cats by country._

```{r, eval=F}
group_by(missing, country) %>% 
  summarize(grumpy_by_country = median(grumpy, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  ungroup()
```

<br>

### <i class="fa fa-user-secret" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#040707;"></i> Pro-tip!
> Ending with `ungroup()` is good practice. This will prevent your data from staying grouped after the summarizing has been completed.

<br>

__Exercise__  

Summarise any trait for the cats by color and one other variable.

<br>

### Grouped `mutate()`

<br>

We can bring back `mutate` to add a column based on the grouped values in a data set. For example, you may want to add a column showing the average age by country to the whole table.  

When you combine `group_by` and `mutate` the new column will be calculated based on the values within each group. 

```{r mutate-age, eval=F}

group_by(missing, country) %>% mutate(country_mean_age = mean(age, na.rm = T))

```

<br>

__Exercise__ _(Save for later)_  

Estimate the mean grumpiness for the cats within each greediness score.

<br>



## Preview for Day 2

<br>

What's better than numerical summaries? Visual charts. Here's how to make a quick 
histogram of the cat ages using `ggplot2`.

Use `install.packages("ggplot2")` to add `ggplot2` to your library.

```{r ggplot1, exercise = TRUE}
library(ggplot2)

missing <- data_frame(cat = 1:100, age = sample(1:12, 100, replace = T), country = sample(c("France", "UK"), 100, replace = T))

ggplot(missing) + geom_density(aes(age), fill = "blue")

# To compare ages by country, assign fill to the country column 
# The alpha value determines the transparency of the colors 
ggplot(missing) + geom_density(aes(age, fill = country), alpha = 0.4)


# To compare ages by color, assign fill to the color column 
ggplot(all_cats) + geom_density(aes(age, fill = color), alpha = 0.4) + facet_wrap(~color)

```

## Practice time!

One big advantage of CSVs is that you can easily share them online with other researchers. Once it's online people can read your data into R without ever needing to download a file. Want to try it?

Kaggle [datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) is one great resource for interesting data. The example below shows how to read in the top 1,000 baby names from 1880 to 2009 and the top 5,000 rated movies on IMDB.


### <i class="fa fa-star" style="color:#ffff00"></i> <i class="fa fa-star" style="color:#ffff00"></i> Bonus level!! <i class="fa fa-star" style="color:#ffff00"></i> <i class="fa fa-star" style="color:#ffff00"></i>

In RStudio, try running the script below for one of the data sets. 

```{r read-url, exercise = TRUE}
# Below are two CSV files from the internet. 
# You can read them into R in the same way as your local CSV files.
library(readr)

# IMDB movies
url <- "https://query.data.world/s/cen2Np2vlZrbaVwyXwFuTBtKVdtayO"

# Baby name trends
url <- "http://github.com/hadley/data-baby-names/raw/master/baby-names.csv"

# Read data from the web
new_df <- read_csv(url)

# View data
new_df
```

<br>

Your assignment is to choose one of the data sets and practice using the `filter()`, `arrange()`, `mutate()`, and `summarize()` functions.  

__Create an R script that answers 3 questions about one of the data sets. We'll use these questions in our next class for making charts.__

Try answering some of these questions if you chose the __IMDB__ data.

1. What were the highest and lowest grossing movies in this database?
1. What actor or actress appears the most times in this database as actor1?
1. How many Facebook likes has this actor or actress received?
1. Filter the data set to your favorite movie, or a movie you have seen. What is the duration of that movie? 
1. What movie has the longest duration? the shortest? Make a table including only the directors and the mean duration of their movies.
1. Make up a question of your own and answer it using the data.

<br>

Try answering some of these questions if you choose the __baby names__ data.  

1. What was the earliest year the data was collected?
1. Is your section managers name in this database? If so, what percentage of the time, by year, is your section managers name used as a baby name (if your section manager's name does not appear in the database use the name "Frank")?
1. How many unique names are included in the database?
1. Pick a year, and make a table with the number of boy names and the number of girl names reported in that year.
1. Pick one name and make a table with the percentage of the time that name was used. Add the following to the table: the mean percentage of the time that name was used.
1. Make up a question of your own and answer it using the data.


```{r, eval=F, echo=F}
