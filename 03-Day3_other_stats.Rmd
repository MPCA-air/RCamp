# Other stats software

When working with other researchers you may come across data stored in a proprietary format such as an SPSS file. Don't worry! R can read and write these files too. No one even has to know we can't afford to use SAS.

There are example data files from other stats software in the folder `X:/Agency_Files/Outcomes/Risk_Eval_Air_Mod/_Air_Risk_Evaluation/R/R_Camp/Student Folder/Sample data`. You can copy some of the files to your R project folder to make it easier to test some of the functions for yourself.

## SAS, SPSS, Stata

![](https://github.com/tidyverse/haven/raw/master/man/figures/logo.png){width="140" align="right" style="margin-left: 25px;"}

<br>

To read and write _SAS_, _SPSS_, or _Stata_ files you can use the `haven` package, which is another member of the _tidyverse_. While it is possible to save data from R in other proprietary formats, we recommend using the _.CSV_ format, as it will be readable by most statistical software and will prevent any future worries about software versions preventing you from opening your data.

## Examples

```{r sas, eval=F}
library(haven)

# SAS
read_sas("sas-data.sas7bdat")

write_sas(mtcars, "mtcars.sas7bdat")


# SPSS
read_sav("spss-data.sav")

write_sav(mtcars, "mtcars.sav")


# Stata
read_dta("stata-data.dta")

write_dta(mtcars, "mtcars.dta")
```


# Minitab, Systat, Matlab

The`foreign` package reads and writes _MiniTab_ and _SYSTAT (SigmaPlot)_ files. When reading these file types you may end up with a _list_ of multiple data items. To access one of the list items use brackets such as `data[1]`, or add the name of the item in the list after a _$_ sign, as in `data$Control`. In some cases it may be easier to ask the original author of the data to export a _.CSV_ file for you.


## Minitab and Systat (SigmaPlot) examples
```{r minitab, eval=F}
library(foreign)

# Minitab
read.mtp("minitab-data.mtp")


# SYSTAT and SigmaPlot
read.systat("systat-old-data.sys") 

read.systat("systat-new-data.syd")

```



## Matlab 

The`R.matlab` package will read and write _Matlab_ files. 

```{r matlab, eval=F}
library(R.matlab)

# Matlab
readMat("matlab-data.mat2") 


```
